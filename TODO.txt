Voltage reading:
there is an offset for measured voltage < 13,8V (-0.05V @ displayed 1V which drops to nearly 0V @ displayed 13.8V - aprox 1.25V ADC input) - Investigate
2.45V input -> 2.4V displayed
8V input -> 7.97V displayed
13V input -> 12.98V displayed
15V input -> 15V displayed

Adjust PID so that a desired constant current is drained from source

Adjust PID so that a desired constant power is drained from source

Change LEM sensor to 10A version for better measurement precision
Put 7x instrumentation differential amplifier after LEM sensor
Change AO to one with lower offset voltage
Change power MOSFET with bipolar darlington with high hFE @ 10-15A (driven directly by AO)
